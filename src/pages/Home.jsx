                  <p> Welcome <br></br>
                      My name is Thomas Watchman. My goal is to help build a positive,
                      human-based AI future, which I call Human 3.0.
                      In order to do that, I am building AI products
                      that upgrade people and organizations—rather than try to replace them.
                      I’m Thomas Watchman, a computer scientist and builder focused on creating technology that strengthens, not replaces, human potential. My goal is to help shape a future where artificial intelligence and people work side by side to amplify creativity, problem-solving, and connection — a vision I call Human 3.0. I’m passionate about developing AI systems that are transparent, ethical, and deeply human-centered, using my background in programming, data analysis, and machine learning to turn ideas into impactful tools. Beyond code, I’m fascinated by how technology shapes society — from how we learn and collaborate to how we find meaning in the digital age. This website is a place to share my projects, experiments, and thoughts as I explore what it means to build technology for people — not just for progress.
